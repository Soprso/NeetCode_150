# 🧠 NeetCode 150 Challenge – C# Solutions

Welcome to my C# implementation of the [NeetCode 150](https://neetcode.io/practice) challenge — a handpicked set of **150 essential coding problems** commonly asked in top tech interviews (FAANG, product-based, startups, etc.).

This repository documents my journey solving each problem using **C#**, with a focus on:
- Writing clean, readable, and testable code
- Practicing Data Structures and Algorithms
- Strengthening core .NET programming skills

## 📂 Folder Structure

Each problem is grouped by its category:

NeetCode_150/
├── Arrays/
│ └── ContainsDuplicate.cs
├── Hashing/
├── TwoPointers/
├── Stack/
├── SlidingWindow/
├── Trees/
├── DynamicProgramming/
└── ...

Each `.cs` file contains:
- ✅ A single problem solution
- 💬 Clear logic and comments
- 🧪 Optionally testable methods (e.g., `static void Main()` or helper functions)
